The entire project has been written in C++. All the dependencies have been encoded into the makefile, which serves as a one-click solution to compile the entire project.

The compilation is simple;

On any UNIX based machine, using make, the project can be compiled.

Navigate to the folder containing the project source using shell, and simply run;

make

Once this command is run, the project will be compiled and an executable will be produced, named "project_cs641".

To run the executable, simply type the following command:

./project_cs641 "input_file.txt" //Replace input_file with the name of the input file you are using.

The program will run and provide all the required details, such as workaround time, scheduling etc.

To clean up the folder, run:

make clean
